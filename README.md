# C99-compilation-automator

## v1.0.0

Tired of using TurboC4 for compiling and running old c99 code?

Well here is a solution for you! Try the compilation automator which compiles your c99 code and runs it automatically!

You can code your files using any editor/IDE and then use the compiler automator to compile your c99 code and run it!

The automator will firstly, compile your code and if there are no errors, i.e compilation is successful, only then will the program be executed.

Otherwise the automator will print out the errors in your program and exit.

## Planned features to be added :

I intend to make this program a lot like the rust compiler, which points out your errors and provides tips to fix it.

Also plan to add linux support.


# Usage:

Just run the compiler_automator.c (make sure your code file is in the same directory as the automator)

Although this will change in the next version, where I will add some cli args and path finding so that the file to be compiled doesn't have to necessarily stay in the same folder as the automator.
