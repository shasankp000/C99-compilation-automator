# C99-compilation-automator

## v1.0.0

Tired of using TurboC4 for compiling and running old c99 code?

Well here is a solution for you! Try the compilation automator which compiles your c99 code and runs it automatically!

You can code your files using any editor/IDE and then use the compiler automator to compile your c99 code and run it!

The automator will firstly, compile your code and if there are no errors, i.e compilation is successful, only then will the program be executed.

Otherwise the automator will print out the errors in your program and exit.

## Planned features to be added :

I intend to make this program a lot like the rust compiler, which points out your errors and provides tips to fix it.
